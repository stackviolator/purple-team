- Aggregate executor names
	- Build out cases for each
	- Can't run stuff thats manual

- Add support for check elevation (bc i am not doing it) (everything works from domainadmin account (lol))

- Think about modularity for different executor engines
	- Currently passing in mythic specific stuff into AtmoicTests, like callback id, etc

- Add argparser
