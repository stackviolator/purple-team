- Check after each test if becaon has died
	- Check tiemout if it hasnt checked in X amount of time after last checkin
	- IF beacon died, switch to backup beacon, if back up beacon dies then box is prob quarantined

- Just run cleanup commands (specify by GUID maybe) (in case a beacon dies when dumping lsass or something)

- Some idea of parent beacon, spawn new beacon to run tests, if the testing becaon dies, spawn a new one

- Update decription to alive, dead, possibly dead or something

- Aggregate executor names
	- Build out cases for each
	- Can't run stuff thats manual

- Add support for check elevation (bc i am not doing it) (everything works from domainadmin account (lol))

- Add argparser

- Write unit tests or whatever

- Keep notes of if some tests/ GUIDs are associated with an APT

- Issues:
	- Evasive testing - i dont have mcuh and my infra sucks lol

- Sort TODO
